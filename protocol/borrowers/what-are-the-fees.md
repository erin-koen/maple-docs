# What are the fees?

Establishment Fees are paid by Borrowers for the work involved in conducting due diligence and facilitating their loan. It is a percentage of the loan and is deducted from the loan amount. Establishment Fees are negotiated between Borrowers and Pool Delegates when creating the loan contract. This fee is split between the Pool Delegate and the Maple Treasury.

Maple also has an Ongoing Fee, however this is deducted from the interest yield in Lending Pools.
