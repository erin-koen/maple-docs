# What collateral do borrowers have to put up?

Borrowers may be able to access undercollateralized loans on Maple. Pool Delegates will assess loan requests and agree interest and collateralization ratios with Borrowers. Prior to withdrawing funds, Borrowers will be required to deposit the agreed collateral to their Loan Vault. This collateral will be released after final repayments are made.
