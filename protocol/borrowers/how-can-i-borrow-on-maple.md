# How to borrow on Maple

Institutions looking to borrow on Maple can request capital by creating a Loan Vault which holds collateral and receiving funding. After submitting requested loan terms, Pool Delegates will review and negotiate terms with Borrowers prior to lending from their managed Lending Pools. This requires a confidential assessment of Borrower reputation, management background, business strategy and financial records. Once Pool Delegates agree terms and approve funding from the Lending Pool, Borrowers will be able to withdraw the requested capital for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.

If you are interested in borrowing on Maple, the waitlist is open for reputable corporate and institutional borrowers. Please reach out to the Maple team on any of our social platforms.
