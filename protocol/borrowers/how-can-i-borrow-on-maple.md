# How to borrow on Maple?

Institutions looking to borrow on Maple can request capital by creating a Loan Vault which holds collateral and receiving funding. After submitting requested loan terms, Pool Delegates will review and negotiate terms with Borrowers prior to lending from their managed Liquidity Pools. This requires a confidential assessment of Borrower reputation, management background, business strategy and financial records. Once Pool Delegates agree terms and approve funding from the Liquidity Pool, Borrowers will be able to withdraw the requested capital for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.

The Maple Launch Pool will be funding an exclusive list of Borrowers. If you are interested in borrowing on Maple, the waitlist is open for reputable corporate and institutional borrowers.
