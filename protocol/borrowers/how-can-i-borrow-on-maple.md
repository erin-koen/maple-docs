# How to borrow on Maple

Institutions looking to borrow on Maple can connect with Pool Delegates through this contact [form](https://maple.finance/contact/#form). Once whitelisted, borrowers can request capital by creating a Loan Vault which holds collateral and receives funding. After submitting a Loan Request, Pool Delegates will review and perform due diligence on the Borrower prior to funding the request from their Lending Pools. This requires a confidential assessment of Borrower reputation, management background, business strategy and financial records. Once Pool Delegates approve funding from the Lending Pool, Borrowers will be able to withdraw the requested capital for a fixed term, at a fixed rate, and at a fixed collateralization level.
