# What criteria do Pool Delegates use to assess borrowers?

When establishing a Liquidity Pool, Pool Delegates will be asked to provide Liquidity Providers with information on their investment strategy. Pool Delegates can be explicit in defining an investment strategy based on region, target Borrower industry, credit quality, and more.

After Borrowers submit their Request for Quote \(RFQ\) for a loan on Maple, Pool Delegates will be able to review the RFQs and engage with Borrowers that are in-line with their Liquidity Pool's strategy. Pool Delegates will assess Borrower reputation and may request Borrowers submit financials for confidential review. This information will be used to calibrate interest and collateral ratios appropriate to each Borrower.
