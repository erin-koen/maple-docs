# How to become a Pool Delegate

### Create Pool and Attract Funding

Once whitelisted, Pool Delegates complete a Profile to be published alongside their Lending Pool. This profile will include their background and their strategy for the Pool.

Next the Pool Delegate will establish their Lending Pool on-chain. They will select the cryptocurrency their Lending Pool will lend in and set the Ongoing Fee charged to Lending Pool for management, including the amount which will go to MPL holders who provide Pool Cover. Pool Delegates will be required to post Maple Tokens (MPL) to their managed Lending Pool to serve as first-loss capital to the Pool and align interests with Lenders.
