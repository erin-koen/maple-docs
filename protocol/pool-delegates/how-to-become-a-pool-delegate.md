# How to become a Pool Delegate

### Create Pool and Attract Funding

Once whitelisted, Pool Delegates complete a Pool Delegate Profile to be published alongside their Liquidity Pool. This profile will include their background and their strategy for the Liquidity Pool.

Next, the Pool Delegate will establish their Liquidity Pool on-chain. They will select the cryptocurrency their Liquidity Pool will lend in and set the Ongoing Fee charged to Liquidity Pool for management, including the amount which will go to MPL holders who stake the Pool. Pool Delegates will be required to stake Maple Tokens \(MPL\) to their managed Liquidity Pool to serve as first-loss capital to the Pool and align interests with Liquidity Providers.

Maple's first Liquidity Pool will be managed by [Orthogonal Trading](https://maplefinance.ghost.io/orthogonal-trading-pool-delegate/). All Pool Delegates on Maple must be whitelisted prior to establishing a Liquidity Pool.
