# Pool Delegates

## What is a Pool Delegate?

Pool Delegates manage Liquidity Pools on Maple. Maple provides a decentralized asset management infrastructure enabling Pool Delegates to attract global capital and provide funding to a network of premium Borrowers, increasing their potential AUM while earning performance fees.

Each Liquidity Pool is managed by a single Pool Delegate. The Pool Delegate is responsible for negotiating loan terms with borrowers, performing diligence, and liquidating collateral in the event of a default. Pool Delegates review a Borrower's reputation, expertise, and performance to evaluate terms of the loan. Once the Borrower and Pool Delegate agree to the interest and collateral ratio, Pool Delegates fund the loans from their managed Pool.
