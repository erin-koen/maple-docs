# How do I stake the Maple Token?

MPL Holders can share in the Ongoing Fees paid on Maple by providing a first-loss reserve available to cover defaults in a Lending Pool of their choosing. MPL holders will deposit a combination of MPL and USDC into a Balancer Pool, and then stake those Balancer Pool Tokens \(BPTs\) to a specific Lending Pool. In order to align incentives, Pool Delegates are required to stake any pools they create.

In the event of liquidation and collateral shortfall, the protocol will liquidate staked tokens in order to cover the difference between the value of the collateral and the Loan balance.
