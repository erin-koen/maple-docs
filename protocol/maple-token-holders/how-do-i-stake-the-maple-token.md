**More information**

At launch, Maple will use [50% of protocol revenues](https://discord.com/channels/576728229449170954/945704101545672774) to buy MPL back from the open market. This MPL will then be evenly distributed to participants that stake their MPL into a Maple owned smart contract and participate in the protocol long-term.

**Expected returns:** Returns from staking are derived from protocol revenues, balances compound overtime, and participants can withdraw at anytime. We estimate initial APYs to be 5–10%.

**Stake as soon as possible:** We are bootstrapping the launch by issuing 30,000 MPL to early stakers, streamed over a three month period. That’s in addition to the DAO using 50% of monthly protocol revenues to buyback MPL from the open market - as mentioned we estimate initial APYs to be 5–10%.

**Stay in control:** Return to the WebApp to monitor returns, stake more MPL, partially or fully unstake at anytime. Returns compound overtime and additional utility will be introduced in Q3.

{% hint style="info" %}
Important information: Simply holding MPL will not earn a share of Maple protocol revenues, MPL must be staked to participate. It’s important to note that staking MPL is separate to providing Pool Cover. By staking MPL you are not providing capital into a first-loss tranche.
