# What fees are shared with MPL holders?

Maple Treasury earns a portion of the fees generated by Maple protocol. The Establishment Fee is  paid by Borrowers when their loans are funded and is shared between Pool Delegates and Maple Treasury.

On a periodic basis, MPL holders will be able to vote on the use of the fees earned by the Treasury. The main options available are:

1. Buyback MPL to be held in treasury
2. Distribute fees to Maple DAO to continue funding operations and growth
3. Distribute fees to MPL holders
