# What fees are shared with MPL holders?

The Maple Treasury earns a portion of the fees generated by the Maple protocol. The Establishment Fee is paid by Borrowers when their loans are funded and is shared between Pool Delegates and the Maple Treasury.

On a periodic basis, MPL holders will be able to vote on the use of the fees earned by the Treasury. The main options available are:

1. Buyback MPL to be held in treasury
2. Distribute fees to Maple DAO to continue funding operations and growth
3. Distribute fees to MPL holders
