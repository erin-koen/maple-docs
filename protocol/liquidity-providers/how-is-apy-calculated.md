# How is APY calculated?

There are multiple APY figures involved in a Maple Lending Pool. Each comes from a combination of platform fees, interest fees, and MPL rewards.

### LP Interest

APY representing the Lender interest is listed on each pool page in the "Your Investment" block on the WebApp. This APY is a fixed interest yield based on the borrower terms the pool participates in. It will change with the interest payments and occurrence of defaults.&#x20;

### MPL Rewards

The MPL Rewards APY is found in the "Liquidity Mining" block of a specific Pool on the WebApp. This is determined by the price of MPL, amount of supply of MPL available and the number of Maple Pool Tokens (MPTs) to earn rewards.

### Aggregate APY

The aggregate APY is determined by the sum of the APY generated by the interest commitments of Borrowers and the liquidity mining opportunity.
