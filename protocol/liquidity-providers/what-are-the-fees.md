# What are the fees?

Establishment Fees are paid by the Borrowers as a percentage of their loan amount. This fee is split between the Pool Delegate and Maple Treasury.

Ongoing Fees are set by the Pool Delegate and deducted from the yield received by Lenders. It is paid to the Pool Delegate and the Maple Token holders who have staked that specific Lending Pool.
