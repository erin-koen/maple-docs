# Maple Protocol Overview V1.0.0

The Maple protocol offers the most capital efficient option for institutional borrowing and fixed income lending in decentralized finance.

## High Level

_Lenders_ can access reliable yield opportunities on Maple by depositing capital into lending pools. These lending pools are managed by experienced professionals, known as _Pool Delegates_.

_Institutional_ _Borrowers_ can access transparent and efficient financing on-chain with Maple, leveraging their reputations to borrow under-collateralized without fear of liquidation and margin calls.

_Pool Delegates_ conduct due diligence and agree on terms with _Borrowers_ before funding loans from their designated Liquidity Pool.

_Lenders_ earn a sustainable yield through diversified exposure to crypto's premium institutions and enjoy a set-and-forget solution as diligence is conducted by _Pool Delegates_.

## Users

_Lenders -_ provide capital to a pool to earn interest from Institutional Borrowers as well as any associated MPL lending rewards.

_Pool Delegates -_  credible experts who launch and manage Lending Pools. They each develop their own investment strategy and underwriting process for determining creditworthy borrowers.

_Borrowers -_ institutions looking for capital to fund operations and grow their business. Borrowers currently include hedge frequency traders, prop traders, market makers, exchanges and centralized lenders with a strong requirement for delta neutral strategies.

_Stakers -_ provide Pool Cover by staking MPL tokens into Pools to provide first loss capital. These tokens will be first to be liquidated in the event a Borrower defaults. Stakers receive a percentage of the interest earned by the pool from borrowers and MPL staking rewards.

## Protocol Overview

### End to End Steps on Maple

1. Maple Governance approves Pool Delegate&#x20;
2. Delegate creates profile and strategy&#x20;
3. Delegate deploys and initiates lending pool&#x20;
4. Delegate activates pool by staking pool cover minimum amount of MPL:USDC Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT)&#x20;
5. Stakers view delegate profile and add additional BPTs for pool cover to desirable pools
6. Lenders (LPs) review delegate profile and add liquidity to desirable pools&#x20;
7. Borrower creates borrower profile and details loan terms&#x20;
8. Delegate views borrower requests and conducts private diligence on terms directly with borrower&#x20;
9. Once terms are agreed, borrower launches loan contract&#x20;
10. Delegate funds the loan contract with the pool liquidity&#x20;
11. Borrower draws down the loan and stakes collateral in one transaction. An Establishment Fee is taken from drawdown and sent to the delegate and Maple DAO Treasury&#x20;
12. Borrower pays interest according to the scheduled repayment cycle and pays principal with final repayment upon maturity&#x20;
13. Delegate claims interest on behalf of the pool throughout the loan term and claims principal with final repayment upon maturity&#x20;
14. Delegates, Lenders, and Stakers can all claim available interest throughout the process

## Protocol Parameters

Parameters associated with the Maple protocol include those that are pool specific (Pool Parameters), and those that affect the entire system (Global Parameters).

### Pool Parameters

These parameters are determined by the Pool Delegate when first configuring and deploying the pool contract.

#### Static Parameters

These parameters define aspects that **cannot be changed** post pool deployment.

_Liquidity Asset_ **-** denominated ERC20 token asset used for a pool to lend to borrowers and accept as interest.

_Delegate Fee_ **-** percentage of interest generated by the pool that is allocated to delegate.

_Staker Fee_ **-** this is the percentage of interest generated by the pool that is given to Stakers.

#### Flexible Parameters

These parameters **can be changed** post pool deployment.

_Pool Capacity_ **-** total liquidity value a pool will accept. Once this value is reached, the pool has no more capacity for additional liquidity.

_Liquidity Access_ **-** delegates determine whether the opportunity to provide liquidity in a pool is open privately to a select list of Ethereum addresses or open publicly to any address.

_Staker Access_ **-** delegates determine whether the opportunity to stake cover for a pool is open privately to a select list of Ethereum addresses or open publicly to any address.

_Lockup Period_ **-** this period determines the length of time liquidity in a pool must be locked prior to withdrawal by LPs or Stakers. The period can be decreased by the pool delegate, but not increased.

### Global Parameters

The global parameters span a broad range of factors that contribute to the possibilities enabled by the Maple protocol. These parameters were first specified by the Maple core team and eventually will be determined via broader Maple governance.

_Treasury Fee -_ fee sent to the Maple DAO Treasury from every loan drawn down from the protocol.

_Delegate Fee -_ fee sent to the delegate from every loan drawn down in their specific pool.

_Cooldown Period_ - the cooldown period is a period of time require to past after an LP or Staker initiates withdraw.
