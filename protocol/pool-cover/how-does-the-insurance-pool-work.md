# How does the Staking Pool work?

Pool Delegates and Maple Token Holders will deposit a combination of MPL and stablecoins into the [MPL:USDC Balancer Pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc1b10e536cd611acff7a7c32a9e29ce6a02ef6ef/) in exchange for Balancer Pool Tokens \(BPT\). Holders will be able to select which pools to stake their BPTs to begin collecting Ongoing Fees. To align incentives with Lenders and stakers, Pool Delegates will be required to stake in their Lending Pools to provide a reserve of first-loss capital.

In the event of a collateral shortfall after liquidation, the outstanding amount can be claimed from the Staking Pool to be redeemed on Balancer for stablecoin which is then distributed to the Lending Pool.
