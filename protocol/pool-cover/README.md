# Staking Pool Cover

Maple creates economic security for their Liquidity Providers through their Staking Pool system. To participate, Stakers deposit liquidity into the [MPL:USDC 50/50 pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc1b10e536cd611acff7a7c32a9e29ce6a02ef6ef/) on Balancer to receive BPTs. With these BPTs, users will be able to decide which pool to stake to provide first-loss capital. Pools will offer different fees and drawdown to those staking BPTs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pool Delegates must stake a minimum of $100,000 worth of BPT when they establish a pool. This creates a level of security for Liquidity Providers. The amount of BPTs required to create a pool is subject to change by Maple DAO vote.
