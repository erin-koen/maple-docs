# Welcome to Maple

Maple Finance is an institutional capital marketplace powered by blockchain technology. On a mission to redefine capital markets through digital assets, Maple expands the digital economy by providing undercollateralized lending for institutional borrowers and fixed-income opportunities for lenders. The economic potential of the future will be fulfilled by harnessing global capital and applying it to areas of greatest opportunity.

Maple offers borrowers transparent and efficient financing completed entirely on-chain. For lenders, Maple offers a sustainable yield source through lending to diversified pools of cryptoâ€™s premium institutions. The Pool Delegates that manage these pools perform diligence and set terms with Borrowers.

The protocol is governed by the Maple Token \(MPL\), which enables token holders to participate in governance, share in fee revenues, and stake insurance to Lending Pools.
