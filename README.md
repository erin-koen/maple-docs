# Welcome to Maple

[Maple is a decentralized corporate credit market](https://maplefinance.ghost.io/introducing-the-maple-protocol/). Maple offers borrowers transparent and efficient financing completed entirely on-chain. For liquidity providers, Maple offers a sustainable yield source through lending to diversified pools of cryptoâ€™s premium institutions. The Pool Delegates that manage these pools perform diligence and set terms with Borrowers.

The protocol is governed by the Maple Token \(MPL\), which enables token holders to participate in governance, share in fee revenues, and stake insurance to Liquidity Pools.

[The technical guide to Maple is available on Github](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/wiki).
