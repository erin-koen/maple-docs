6\) Interested Pool Delegates will contact borrowers directly to begin conducting diligence and negotiating rates. Once terms have been agreed, the borrower is ready to "Deploy your Loan" on-chain.

7\) The Loan Contract is now ready. This dashboard provides status updates on the loan funding. If the loan is not fully funded within seven days, the contract will be voided and partial funds will be returned to lending pools.

8\) Once the Loan Contract is fully funded, borrower will be able to "Withdraw Available Funds". Any required collateral will be withdrawn from the borrowers wallet and the establishment fee will be deducted from the loan proceeds with the net proceeds of the loan disbursed to the borrowers wallet. The establishment fee deducted from the loan proceeds is split 50% / 50% between the Maple Treasury and the Pool Delegate

9\) Once the loan is deployed, borrowers will be able to access this dashboard to make their interest repayments and view the terms of their outstanding loan. The final payment will prompt repayment of the principal.
