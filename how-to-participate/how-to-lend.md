# How to lend

This is the easiest way to earn with Maple Finance. Lenders deposit into a pool to earn fixed interest denominated in the pool's liquidity asset. This interest is determined by the terms set the pool delegate and borrowers. Additionally, lenders will earn MPL rewards from liquidity mining in select pools.

3. Deposit USDC as a Liquidity Provider to earn Maple Pool Tokens \(MPTs\)
4. **To earn MPL rewards, you must deposit your MPTs to the Liquidity Mining contract**
5. You will be able to claim your USDC interest and mined MPL tokens from the webapp

_Deposits will be locked for a six month period in order to fund consecutive tranches of institutional loans on Maple. **There is no minimum deposit amount to participate.**_
