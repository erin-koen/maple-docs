This is the easiest way to earn with Maple Finance. Lenders deposit into a pool to earn interest denominated in the pool's liquidity asset. This interest is determined by the terms set the pool delegate and borrowers. Additionally, lenders will earn MPL rewards from liquidity mining in select pools.

Before lending, you will need to prepare USDC in your Ethereum wallet and ETH for gas payments. **You will not need MPL tokens to participate in lending.**

1. Head to the [Maple webapp](https://app.maple.finance/#/liquidity) to see an overview of all our available pools. Click on a pool to see more details.
