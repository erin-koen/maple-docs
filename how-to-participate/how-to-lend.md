# How to lend

This is the easiest way to earn with Maple Finance. Lenders deposit into a pool to earn interest denominated in the pool's liquidity asset. This interest is determined by the terms set the pool delegate and borrowers. Additionally, lenders will earn MPL rewards from liquidity mining in select pools.

Before lending, you will need to prepare USDC in your Ethereum wallet and ETH for gas payments. **You will not need MPL tokens to participate in lending.**

1. Deposit USDC on the [Maple webapp](https://app.maple.finance/#/liquidity) to a Lending Pool of your choice
2. You will receive Pool Tokens representing your share of the Lending Pool (shown as MPL-LP in your wallet)
3. Follow the Earn MPL steps to begin earning MPL Lending rewards
4. Return to the Maple webapp at any time to claim your USDC interest and MPL token rewards

_Deposits will be locked for a 90 day period. **There is no minimum deposit amount to participate.**_
