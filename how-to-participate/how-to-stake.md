# How to stake

Lending pools mitigate risk by rewarding Stakers who add to the Pool Cover. The value of Pool Cover held provides a buffer for Lending capital in the pool in the event that Borrowers default. If a Borrower defaults the Pool Cover will be liquidated to cover the default amount before any loss is incurred by Lenders in the Pool. As a reward for putting their capital at risk, Stakers earn a percentage of the interest generated by the pool and MPL rewards.

#### Steps to Participate <a href="#steps-to-participate" id="steps-to-participate"></a>

1\. Deposit both MPL and USDC to the MPL:USDC 50:50 Balancer Pool in exchange for Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs) [here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc1b10e536cd611acff7a7c32a9e29ce6a02ef6ef/).

_IMPORTANT: While the best method is to deposit a combination of both MPL and USDC, there is an option to deposit only one asset. The difference between the two methods is price slippage as for the same dollar amount, you get a better value (more BPT on deposit, fewer required to withdraw) by doing multi-asset provision rather than single-asset._&#x20;

2\. Head to the [Maple webapp](https://app.maple.finance/#/liquidity) and browse the available Lending Pools. Once you have made your selection on which pool(s) you'd like to stake, click into the Pool Dashboard, connect your wallet, and select "Staking".
