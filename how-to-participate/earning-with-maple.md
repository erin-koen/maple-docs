Pool Delegates use a compelling strategy to find approval by Maple governance to launch a pool contract, attract capital, and commit loans. For their efforts they receive two fees:

1. Pool-specific portion of the interest accrued from borrowers
2. Portion of the establishment fee taken upon drawdown of each loan associated with their pool

Pool Delegates undergo a rigorous approval process to ensure quality of liquidity pool management.
